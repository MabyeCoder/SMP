About SMP(Simple):
  A New Simple Programing Language Made With Python 
  I Made it to do functions that take atleast 10 lines in one line
  It has 5 Fully Functions (For Now)
 
How To Use:
  Create A File And Make it .smp Make it's location in same folder With Run.py
  Then Open CMD and Go To Run.py + your file.smp then Write The Following Code:

  To Print Something:
    Say "Your Text Goes Here"
  To Print Variables:
    Say !Variable Name
  To Make New Variable:
    !Variable Name = "Variable Value"
  To do Input And Print It's Value:
    Input "Your Text" !Test
    Say !Test 
  it will print what you put in the input
  To Do Some Math Functions
    Say 1+1..bla bla bla
    or 
    !test = 1+1
    Say !test.. bla bla bla
   To Do 'Do Event' With Input:
    Input "Enter Your Name: " !Name
    Do "Hello Mr:" "Bye Mr" "Ahmed" !Name
    Say !Name
    
    This will print "Hello Mr:" if Variable !Name(which is input) is "Ahmed" if it isn't "Ahmed" then it will print "Bye Mr:"
    The Last Line 'Say !Name'
    Only To Say The Variable Name after you can edit it..
    
    I'm working to fix it's bugs and add more functions
